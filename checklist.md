# Sprint Challenge: Authentication - Dad Jokes

## Description

In this challenge, you build a real wise-guy application. _Dad jokes_ are all the rage these days. Currently the application is trying to receive some `Dad Jokes`, however we are locked out.


## Minimum Viable Product

Implement an User Authentication System. Hash user's passwords before saving them to the database. Use `JSON Web Tokens` or `Sessions and Cookies` to persist authentication across requests.

- [x] Implement the `register` and `login` functionality inside `/auth/auth-router.js`. A `user` has `username` and `password`. Both properties are required.
- [ ] Implement the `authenticate` middleware inside `/auth/authenticate-middleware.js`.
- [ ] Write a **minimum o 2 tests** per API endpoint. Write more tests if you have time.

**Note**: the database already has the users table, but if you run into issues, the migrations are available.

## Stretch Problem

Build a front end to show the jokes.

- [ ] Add a React client that connects to the API and has pages for `Sign Up`, `Sign In` and showing a list of `Jokes`.
- [ ] Once you have the functionality down, style it!
